# DES-Simulation-Assignment2
This project focuses on Discrete Event Simulation of Simple Queues.

This study investigates the performance of queuing systems by comparing M/M/n, M/D/n and hyper-exponential queues through discrete-event simulations. It investigates the role of service rate distribution and scheduling policies - FIFO and SJF - on the average waiting
time, especially under high system load. The results show that the multi-server model significantly reduces the waiting time, with SJF outperforming FIFO in terms of efficiency and fairness. The research also finds that the deterministic service model provides predictability,
whereas the hyper-exponential model shows greater variability, posing a challenge for system management. These insights have practical implications for optimising real-world service systems.
